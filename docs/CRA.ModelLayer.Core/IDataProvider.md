# IDataProvider interface

Identifies a generic data provider. The data provider is the way a generic class can receive data from an external source (e.g. a form of persistence, like a DB). This empty interface is used as a marker for identifieng the data providers, but does not require any implementation, since the real methods are specific to the kind of data to retrieve.

```csharp
public interface IDataProvider
```
