# IVarInfoClass interface

Interface implemented by VarInfo classes. For each domain class there should be a VarInfoClass: a matching class, which is conventionally called as the value class plus the postfix VarInfo, that contains the description of the variables of the domain class. The corresponding domain class is referenced here as the 'domain class of reference'

```csharp
public interface IVarInfoClass
```
