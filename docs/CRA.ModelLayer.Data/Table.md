# Table class

Lightweight version of the [`DataTable`](./Table/DataTable.md), to be used with [`DataCollection`](./DataCollection.md).

```csharp
public class Table
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Table](Table/Table.md)(…) | Constructor that builds a new Table not belonging to a [`DataCollection`](./DataCollection.md). |
| [ColumnNames](Table/ColumnNames.md) { get; } | Returns an enumeration of all the columns added to this Table |
| [DataTable](Table/DataTable.md) { get; } | Returns a classic [`DataTable`](./Table/DataTable.md) representation of this Table. No verification of primary key nor relationships is performed (in fact none of these can be enforced in this lightweight version). Each `null` value contained in the rows is converted to a DBNull.Value |
| [Name](Table/Name.md) { get; } | Returns the name with which this Table has been instantiated. |
| [Rows](Table/Rows.md) { get; } | Returns an enumeration of all the rows inserted in this Table, in insertion order. |
| [AddColumn](Table/AddColumn.md)(…) | Adds a new column to this Table, having the name and type passed has parameters. |
| [AddRow](Table/AddRow.md)(…) | Adds a new row to this Table. (2 methods) |
| [GetColumnDescriptor](Table/GetColumnDescriptor.md)(…) | Returns the ColumnDescriptor for the column having the name passed as parameter. |
| [GetColumnValue](Table/GetColumnValue.md)(…) | Returns the value, contained in the row passed as parameter, corresponding to the column with the name passed as parameter. |
| [ModifyCell](Table/ModifyCell.md)(…) | Sets, in the row passed as the parameter 'row', the value 'newValue' in the column having the name 'columnName'. The method throws [`DataCollectionException`](./DataCollectionException.md) if the Table does not contain a column named 'columnName', or if, in the case checkType is true, the type of newValue is not compatible with the column type. This last check is not performed if checkType is false. (2 methods) |

## Remarks

Like in the version of the Microsoft framework, it is possible to add columns and data rows, but no verification of primary key nor relationships is performed (in fact none of these can be enforced in this lightweight version). This in order to keep overhead in using this class to a minumum. A [`DataTable`](./Table/DataTable.md) version of a Table can be built by invoking the property [`Table.DataTable`](./Table/DataTable.md), but again on the obtained object no primary key nor relationship constraint is enforced. Each row in the Table consists of an array of objects (object[]). This array must have the same number of elements as the number of columns added to the Table. While adding a row, by default no type check of the elements of the array is performed against the types with which each column has been added to the Table, unless the programmer explicitly asks for this by using a boolean flag "checkType". This, again, to keep overhead in using this class to a minimum.
