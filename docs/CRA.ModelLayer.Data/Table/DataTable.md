# Table.DataTable property

Returns a classic `DataTable` representation of this Table. No verification of primary key nor relationships is performed (in fact none of these can be enforced in this lightweight version). Each `null` value contained in the rows is converted to a DBNull.Value

```csharp
public DataTable DataTable { get; }
```
