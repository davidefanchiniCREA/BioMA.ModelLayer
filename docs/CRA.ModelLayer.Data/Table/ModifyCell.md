# Table.ModifyCell method (2 of 2)

Sets, in the row passed as the parameter 'row', the value 'newValue' in the column having the name 'columnName'. The method throws [`DataCollectionException`](../DataCollectionException.md) if the Table does not contain a column named 'columnName', or if, in the case checkType is true, the type of newValue is not compatible with the column type. This last check is not performed if checkType is false.

```csharp
public void ModifyCell(object[] row, string columnName, object newValue, bool checkType)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| row | The row in which the value has to be modified. |
| columnName | The column for which the value has to be modified. |
| newValue | The new value to set. |
| checkType | If true, a type check is performed on the value to verify its compliancy with the column's type. If the type is not compliant a [`DataCollectionException `](../DataCollectionException.md)is thrown. If this parameter is false, the type check is not performed. |

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| [DataCollectionException](../DataCollectionException.md) | If this table does not contain a column with the name specified as parameter, or if, in the case checkType is true, the type of newValue is not compatible with the column type. |
